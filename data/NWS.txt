# Job Title:
Software Engineer

# Job Summary:
Northwood is seeking a versatile and innovative Software Engineer to join our team and help design, implement, and optimize global services that deliver high-performance connectivity to our customers. This role involves ownership of core system areas—ranging from ground station control systems to customer-facing APIs—and offers the opportunity to work across multiple domains in a full-stack, highly technical environment.

Ideal candidates will enjoy solving complex technical problems and thrive in a fast-paced, multidisciplinary team setting where they can dive deep into both hardware-level control and large-scale distributed systems.

# Responsibilities:

Design and develop control systems for ground station hardware interacting with embedded devices and RF modems.

Architect and optimize high-bandwidth data pipelines for global data movement and SD-WAN capabilities.

Design distributed systems and cloud orchestration frameworks to support global ground network operations.

Build robust APIs, intuitive front-end interfaces, and scalable data backends.

Develop and implement monitoring and alerting tools for software and infrastructure uptime.

Transform telemetry into actionable insights using predictive diagnostics and real-time data visibility.

Support global infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines for secure and reliable deployments.

Develop production line testing and automation tools to ensure system reliability and performance.

Create simulations for satellite networks and design orchestration software for global antenna systems.

# Qualifications:
Basic Qualifications:

1+ years of professional software development experience (internships, projects, or personal work also considered).

Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Math, or a related field (or equivalent experience).

Preferred Qualifications:

Proficiency in one or more programming languages: Rust, Golang, Haskell, C/C++ (or others suited to distributed systems and HPC).

Experience with distributed systems design and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).

Familiarity with microservices architecture, serverless computing, and cloud orchestration.

Experience interacting with hardware, FPGAs, and embedded systems (e.g., FreeRTOS, Zephyr).

Strong networking knowledge and experience with high-speed communications (10GigE+).

Proficiency with RESTful APIs and modern front-end frameworks (React, Angular, etc.).

Experience with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK) and alerting systems.

Knowledge of Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, Ansible) and CI/CD (Jenkins, GitLab).

Familiarity with relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and time-series (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) databases.

Experience building simulations and orchestration engines for distributed physical or software systems.

Strong communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills.

Comfortable working in a fast-paced, highly technical, and evolving environment.
